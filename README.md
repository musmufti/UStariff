# US Tariffs Impact on Pakistan's Exports Dashboard

## Project Overview
This interactive dashboard visualizes the potential impact of the recently imposed 29% US tariffs on Pakistan's exports. The analysis examines various scenarios and economic implications across different sectors, with special focus on Pakistan's textile industry which accounts for 79% of the country's $5.5 billion exports to the United States.

## Purpose
This project was created to:
- Provide data-driven insights on international trade policy effects
- Visualize complex economic relationships between tariff rates and export dynamics
- Compare Pakistan's position with other countries affected by recent US tariff policies
- Evaluate sector-specific vulnerabilities, particularly in textiles

## Features
- Interactive scenario analysis (Low, Medium, High impact)
- Comparative tariff analysis with other major exporters
- Sector-specific impact visualization
- Monthly export projections
- Competitive position analysis with selectable countries
- Comprehensive data sources and methodology

## Methodology
The dashboard employs economic elasticity models to project three impact scenarios (low, medium, and high) based on historical trade patterns and market sensitivity. The competitive position analysis examines multiple dimensions including price competitiveness, quality standards, delivery times, compliance, tariff resilience, and market access factors.

## Data Sources
All visualizations are based on data from reputable sources including:
- Official government trade statistics
- Economic analysis from research institutions
- News reports on trade policy developments
- Industry assessments of sector-specific impacts

Full citations are provided in the "Data Sources & Methodology" section of the dashboard.

## Technical Implementation
This dashboard was built using:
- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for structure and interactivity
- Chart.js for data visualization components
- GitHub Pages for deployment and hosting
